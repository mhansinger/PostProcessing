This file extracts radial field values from OpenFoam data

What you have to do is:
- check if scalarTail and speciesTail in line 18&19 corresponds to your sampled output fiÄºes in sampleDict/TIME
- datapoints and noFiles ind line 22 & 23 is correct, therefore you have to check the length of your files!
- check if Output_np and Output_df in line 120 and 129 comprise all the arrays you need or if something is missing!
